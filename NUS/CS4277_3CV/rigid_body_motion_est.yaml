    What is a **bound vector**?

    If p has coordinates X and q has coordinates Y, then v has coordinates:
    [$$]v = Y - X \in \mathbb{R}^3[/$$]

    What is a **free vector**?
  back: |
    Two pairs of points [$](p, q), (p', q')[/$] with coordinates satisfying
    - [$]X = Y' - X'[/$] define the **same** free vector.

    A free vector does *not* depend on its base point.

    A map [$]g: \mathbb{R}^3 \mapsto \mathbb{R}^3[/$] that:

    Why do we perform **reverse mapping** of a planar projective transformation?

# 2D Homography

- type: markdown
  id: 16  # (generated)
  front: |
    What is a 2D Homography?
  back: |
    - **Given**: A set of **point correspondences** [$]x_i \leftrightarrow
    x_i'[/$] between two images
    - **Compute**: The **2D Homography** H, such that [$]Hx_i = x_i'[/$] for each i.
- type: markdown
  id: 17  # (generated)
  front: |
    How *many* **corresponding points** are required to compute H (2D Homography)?
  back: |
    H has 8 dof, and each point correspondence gives 2 constraints.
    -> 4 point correspondences
- type: markdown
  id: 18  # (generated)
  front: |
    Why are in practice more the 4 point correspondences used to constrain H?
  back: |
    Messurements contain noise, thus more correspondences and the
    **least-squares solution** is used.

    What is the objective of the Direct Linear Transform (DLT) Algorithm
  back: |
    Given [$]n \geq 4[/$] 2D to 2D point correspondences [$]\\{ x_i \leftrightarrow x_i'\\}[/$]
    determine the 2D homography matrix H such that [$]x_i' = Hx_i[/$]
- type: markdown
  id: 20  # (generated)
  front: |
    Give an overview of how the Direct Linear Transform (DLT) Algorithm works.
  back: |
    1. For each correspondence compute [$]A_i[/$]. Usually only two first rows needed.
    2. Assemble n [$]2 \times 9[/$] matrices [$]A_i[/$] into a single [$]2n \times 9[/$] matrix A
    3. Obtain SVD of A. Solution for h is the last column of V.
    4. Determine H from h.
- type: markdown
  id: 21  # (generated)
  front: |
    What happens if *three* of the minimum four points correspondences are **collinear**? 
  back: |
    The Rank of matrix A drops below 8, and we cannot solve for h.
- type: markdown
  id: 22  # (generated)
  front: |
    Do we need to check the selected points before performing DLT?
  back: |
    Check that selected points are not in the critical configuration, i.e. **collinear**.
- type: markdown
  id: 23  # (generated)
  front: |
    Why is data normalisation important before doing the SVD in DLT?
  back: |
    Orders of magnitude difference in constraint matrix causes bad behavior in the SVD solution.
- type: markdown
  id: 24  # (generated)
  front: |
    How can Data normalization be carried out?
  back: |
    By a tranformation of the points:
    1. Points are translated so that their centroid is at the origin.
    2. Points are then scaled so that the average distance from the origin is
    equal to sqrt(2).
    3. Transformation is applied to each of the two images independently.

    What is the **algebraic distance**?
