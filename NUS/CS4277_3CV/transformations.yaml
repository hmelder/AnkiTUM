    What is a **Planar Projective Transform**?
  back: |
    - *linear* transformation on homogenenous vectors
    - represented by **non-singular** matrix H

    [$]x' = Hx[/$]

    What is the **fundamental property of a homography**?
  back: |
    It always maps a straight line to a straight line.

    What is the group of all 3x3 homographies?
  back: |
    PL(3) (*projective linear*)
- type: markdown
  front: |
    How is PL(3) constructed?
  back: |
    We partition GL(3) into **equivalence classes** where all the 3x3 matrices
    in the same class are related by scalar multiples.

    What subgroups of PL(3) are we interested in?

    **Projective** <- **Affine** <- **Similarity** <- **Euclidean**
