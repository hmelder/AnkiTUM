    What is a **Planar Projective Transform**?
  back: |
    - *linear* transformation on homogenenous vectors
    - represented by **non-singular** matrix H

    [$]x' = Hx[/$]

    What is the **fundamental property of a homography**?
  back: |
    It always maps a straight line to a straight line.

  front: |
    What is the group of all 3x3 homographies?
  back: |
    PL(3) (*projective linear*)
- type: markdown
  id: 3  # (generated)
  front: |
    How is PL(3) constructed?
  back: |
    We partition GL(3) into **equivalence classes** where all the 3x3 matrices
    in the same class are related by scalar multiples.

    What subgroups of PL(3) are we interested in?
  back: |-
    **Projective** <- **Affine** <- **Similarity** <- **Euclidean**

    What is the **general planar projective transform?
  back: |
    [$$]\begin{bmatrix} A & \vec{t} \\\ \vec{v}^T & v\end{bmatrix}[/$$]

    with [$]A = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\\ a_{21} & a_{22} \end{bmatrix}[/$],
    [$]\vec{t} = \begin{pmatrix} t_x \\\ t_y \end{pmatrix}[/$],
    [$]\vec{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\ v_2 \end{pmatrix}[/$]

    What implication does it have for homography H to be homogeneous?
  back: |
    Only the *ratios* of elements of H are important.

# Affine Transformations

- type: markdown
  id: 7  # (generated)
  front: |
    How are **affine transformations** commonly expressed as?
  back: |
    [$]\begin{pmatrix} x_1' \\\ x_2' \\\ 1\end{pmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & t_x \\\ a_{21} & a_{22} & t_y \\\ 0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\ x_2 \\\ 1\end{pmatrix}[/$]
- type: markdown
  id: 8  # (generated)
  front: |
    Is the **affine transformations** Matrix A singular?
  back: |
    No. It is **non-singular**
- type: cloze
  id: 9  # (generated)
  front: |
    A not only takes straight lines into straight lines, it also keeps {{c1::parallel}} lines {{c1::parallel}}.
- type: cloze
  id: 10 # (generated)
  front: |
    A homography H is *affine* if and only if the {{c1::line at infinity}} is mapped to the {{c1::line at infinity}}

# Similarity Transformations

- type: markdown
  id: 11  # (generated)
  front: |
    How is the similarity group obtained from the affine group?
  back: |
    By requiring that A be orthogonal: [$]A^TA = \lambda^2I[/$]
- type: cloze
  id: 12 # (generated)
  front: |
    Similarity transform preserves {{c1::angles}} 

# Euclidean Transformations

- type: markdown
  id: 13  # (generated)
  front: |
    How is the euclidean group obtained from the similarity group?
  back: |
    By further requiring that A be orthonormal: [$]A^TA = I[/$].
- type: cloze
  id: 14  # (generated)
  front: |
    The group of euclidean transformations corresponds to {{c1::rigid body motions}} 
- type: cloze
  id: 15  # (generated)
  front: |-
    Euclidean transformations preserve the {{c1::euclidean distance}} between
    any two points in the domain plane.
