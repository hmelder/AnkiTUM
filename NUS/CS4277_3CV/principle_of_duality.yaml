    What are Circular Points?
  back: |
    Points of intersection of *any* circle in a plane with [$]l_\infty[/$].

    How many are Circular Points are there?
  back: |
    Since there can be at most **two intersection points between a line and a
    circle**, we have **two circular points**.

    [$]\vec{I} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\ i \\\ 0\end{pmatrix}, \\ \vec{J} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\ -i \\\ 0\end{pmatrix}[/$]

    What is the dual degenerate conic?
  back: |
    It is the degenerate conic where each line is replaced by a point, the circular points.
